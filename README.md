# World_Weather_Analysis
This analysis helps travels to check out the best timing for travels. 



### Background

This is the beta version of an app called PlanMyTrip app. 
I will need to add the weather description to the weather data that Iâ€™ve already retrieved in this module. Then, I'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.


## Deliverables
